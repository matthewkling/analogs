# Climate velocity: geographically nearest climate analogs

Finds, for each focal location, the geographic nearest neighbor(s) in a
reference dataset that satisfy a specified maximum climate distance
threshold. Distances to these analogs, divided by time elapsed, give
analog-based climate velocity (Hamann et al. 2015; Dobrowski and Parks
2016).

## Usage

``` r
analog_velocity(
  x,
  pool,
  x_cov = NULL,
  y = NULL,
  weight = NULL,
  coord_type = "auto",
  max_clim,
  max_geog = NULL,
  k = 1,
  index_res = "auto",
  cell_area_weight = "auto",
  n_threads = NULL,
  downsample = 1,
  seed = NULL,
  progress = FALSE
)
```

## Arguments

- x:

  Focal locations for which analogs will be found. Should be a
  matrix/data.frame with columns x, y, and climate variables, or a
  SpatRaster with climate variable layers.

- pool:

  The reference dataset to search for analogs. Either:

  - Matrix/data.frame with columns x, y, and climate variables, or
    SpatRaster with climate variable layers, OR

  - An `analog_index` object created by
    [`build_analog_index()`](https://matthewkling.github.io/analogs/reference/build_analog_index.md)
    (for repeated queries).

- x_cov:

  Optional focal-specific covariance matrices for Mahalanobis distance
  calculations. Should be a matrix or data.frame with one row per focal
  location and one column per unique covariance component, or a
  SpatRaster with a layer for each component. For n climate variables,
  there are n\*(n+1)/2 unique components, ordered as: variances first
  (diagonals), then covariances (upper triangle by row).

- y:

  Optional vector, factor, matrix/data.frame, or SpatRaster giving
  values for each reference location (must have same number of
  rows/cells as `pool`). Required for stats `"sum"`, `"mean"`,
  `"weighted_sum"`, `"weighted_mean"`, `"regression"`, and `"tabulate"`.
  Numeric for continuous stats; factor or coercible-to-factor
  (character, integer, logical) for `stat = "tabulate"`.

- weight:

  Optional pool site weights for use in aggregation. Numeric vector,
  single-column matrix/data.frame, or single-layer SpatRaster, with one
  value per row/cell of `pool`. For aggregation stats like
  `"weighted_mean"`, `"regression"`, etc., weights multiply through the
  weighted aggregation alongside any kernel weighting and cell-area
  weighting; they do not influence which analogs are selected by `knn_*`
  modes (selection remains distance-only). They are reported in pair
  mode as a `user_weight` column. Values must be non-negative; `NA` is
  allowed and treated as 0 (the point is excluded from aggregation).
  Default `NULL` means no user-supplied weights.

  If you want to exclude a static subset of pool sites entirely, masking
  `pool` (and any associated `y` / `covariates`) upfront is more
  efficient than passing `weight = 0` for those sites, since the lattice
  index will not have to scan or distance-compute against them. Use
  `weight = 0` for cases where the mask varies per query against a
  shared index, or where some sites have a continuous weight and others
  should be excluded.

- coord_type:

  Coordinate system type:

  - `"auto"` (default): Automatically detect from coordinate ranges.

  - `"lonlat"`: Unprojected lon/lat coordinates (uses great-circle
    distance; assumes `max_geog` is in km).

  - `"projected"`: Projected XY coordinates (uses planar distance;
    assumes `max_geog` is in projection units).

- max_clim:

  Maximum climate distance constraint (default: NULL = no climate
  constraint). Can be either:

  - A scalar: Euclidean radius in climate space (e.g., 0.5)

  - A vector: Per-variable absolute differences (length must equal
    number of climate variables)

  Only reference locations within this climate distance are considered.
  When `x_cov` is provided, scalar thresholds are interpreted in
  Mahalanobis distance units.

- max_geog:

  Maximum geographic distance constraint (default: NULL = no geographic
  constraint). When specified, only reference locations within this
  distance are considered. Radius units should be specified in
  kilometers if `coord_type = "lonlat"`, or in projected coordinate
  units if `coord_type = "projected"`.

- k:

  Number of nearest analogs to return per focal location for kNN
  selection modes. Required when `select` is `"knn_geog"` or
  `"knn_clim"`; must be `NULL` for `select = "all"`.

- index_res:

  Tuning parameter giving the number of bins per dimension of the
  internally-used lattice search index. Either:

  - A positive integer.

  - `"auto"` (the default): Automatically tune the index resolution by
    optimizing compute time on a subsample of focal points. If focal has
    relatively few rows, auto-tuning is skipped and a default resolution
    of 16 is used.

  Ignored if `pool` is an `analog_index` (uses index's resolution).

- cell_area_weight:

  Controls cell-area weighting when `pool` is a raster. One of `"auto"`
  (default; on for raster pools, off otherwise), `TRUE` (force on;
  errors if `pool` is not a SpatRaster), or `FALSE` (force off).
  Cell-area weights correct aggregation statistics for non-uniform cell
  areas (e.g. lonlat grids near the poles, or projected grids on
  non-equal-area projections); they are computed via
  [`terra::cellSize()`](https://rspatial.github.io/terra/reference/cellSize.html)
  and normalized to mean 1. When `pool` is a pre-built `analog_index`,
  this argument must agree with the index's stored configuration:
  `cell_area_weight = FALSE` errors if the index was built with
  cell-area weighting on (rebuild the index instead).

- n_threads:

  Optional integer number of threads to use for the computation. If
  `NULL` (default), the global RcppParallel setting is used (see
  [`RcppParallel::setThreadOptions`](https://rdrr.io/pkg/RcppParallel/man/setThreadOptions.html)).

- downsample:

  Optional downsampling rate (0-1) for the reference pool, indicating
  the proportion of points to retain. Values \< 1 reduce memory and
  improve speed at some cost to precision. Default is 1.0 (no
  downsampling). Ignored if `pool` is a pre-built index.

- seed:

  Optional random seed for reproducible downsampling. If `NULL`
  (default), uses current R random state. Ignored if `pool` is a
  pre-built index or `downsample = 1`.

- progress:

  Logical; if `TRUE`, display a progress bar during computation.
  Progress tracking works by splitting the focal dataset into chunks and
  processing them sequentially. Useful for large datasets. Default is
  `FALSE`.

## Value

A data.frame, or a SpatRaster when `x` is one and `k = 1`. Contains one
row per focal-analog pair with `index`, `x`, `y`, `analog_index`,
`analog_x`, `analog_y`, `clim_dist`, and `geog_dist`. See
[`analog_search()`](https://matthewkling.github.io/analogs/reference/analog_search.md)
for full column conventions and
[`metadata()`](https://matthewkling.github.io/analogs/reference/metadata.md)
for attached metadata attributes.

## Details

This function is a wrapper that calls
[`analog_search()`](https://matthewkling.github.io/analogs/reference/analog_search.md)
using `select = "knn_geog"` and `stat = "none"`. Note that it **does not
return velocity per se**—it returns geographic and climatic distances to
each focal site's nearest analog(s); to compute velocity, you can divide
these geographic distances by the length of time elapsed between your
`x` and `pool` datasets.
