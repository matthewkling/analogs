\title{Climate velocity: nearest geographic analogs within a climate envelope}
\usage{
analog_velocity(
  focal,
  ref,
  max_clim,
  k = 1,
  max_geog = NULL,
  coord_type = "auto",
  report_dist = TRUE,
  n_threads = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{focal}{Data.frame, matrix, or SpatRaster containing focal locations.
Must include columns \code{x}, \code{y}, and one or more climate variables.}

\item{ref}{Data.frame, matrix, or SpatRaster containing reference locations.
Must be structured like \code{focal}.}

\item{max_clim}{Maximum allowable climate distance between a focal and an
analog. May be:
\itemize{
  \item a scalar: an Euclidean radius in climate space, or
  \item a vector: per-variable absolute differences.
}
Only reference locations within this climate envelope are considered.}

\item{k}{Number of nearest geographic analogs to return for each focal
(default = 1).}

\item{max_geog}{Optional additional geographic constraint in kilometers.
If provided, analogs must be within \code{max_geog} km of the focal.}

\item{coord_type}{One of \code{"auto"}, \code{"lonlat"}, or
\code{"projected"}, indicating how geographic distance should be computed.
\code{"auto"} attempts to infer this from coordinate ranges.}

\item{report_dist}{Logical; if TRUE (default), include climate and geographic
distance columns in the output.}

\item{n_threads}{Number of parallel compute threads to use.}
}
\value{
A data.frame with one row per focal–analog pair, including:
  \itemize{
    \item \code{focal_index}, \code{analog_index}
    \item \code{focal_x}, \code{focal_y}, \code{analog_x}, \code{analog_y}
    \item \code{clim_dist}, \code{geog_dist} (if \code{report_dist = TRUE})
  }
Diagnostic attributes (e.g., binning statistics) from the underlying spatial
index are preserved.
}
\description{
Computes, for each focal location, the geographic nearest neighbor(s) in a
reference dataset that satisfy a specified climate distance threshold. This
helper wraps \code{\link{find_analogs}} using \code{mode = "knn_geog"} and is
most commonly used for estimating climate velocity (the rate and direction
at which organisms would have to move to track constant climate conditions).
}
\details{
For each focal point, this function:
\enumerate{
  \item Identifies all reference points satisfying the climate (and optional
        geographic) threshold(s).
  \item Among those, selects the \code{k} nearest in \emph{geographic}
        distance.
}

This is the classical operation needed for estimating \emph{climate
velocity}: the minimum relocation distance needed to maintain similar
climatic conditions under temporal change.

\dontrun{
v <- velocity(
  focal = clim$clim1,
  ref   = clim$clim2,
  max_clim = 0.5,
  k = 1
